# University-Website
After creating my portfolio, I was feeling more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and
                                wanted to continue to deepen my skills.
                                I chose to create a college website based on the materials I was reading and watching. I
                                wanted a project that was more complicated, as well as focused on consistency and
                                clarity.
Again, I used Visual Studio Code. To begin, I created five HTML files, one for each page
                                of the website. I also created one CSS file to stylize the page and a PHP file to allow
                                for form submission. I used Javascript to make it more dynamic.
I only ran into a few bumps along the road, which I was able to rectify by watching more
                                YouTube tutorials and another course on CodeAcademy.
I decided to use my portfolio domain name to ensure the site does not live without
                                context, and followed the same steps as in my portfolio to push it live.
Again, I will revisit this project to continue experimenting and evolving my skills!
